TODO

- Configure web crawler to only grab stats you want from the table (or a way to automatically filter them after)

- Determine how to grab PER 

- Define exact stats you want to grab

- Develop automated process to convert CSV to JSON 

- Develop search of JSON - (hash or map serach?) 

- Look into how to store data in cache so you don't need to load it each time

- Look into broad process of storing data in database and having the extension load it when needed

- Feature: only works on urls that contain "NBA" or a sports related string

- Develop UI including box appearance 
   Name
   Stats
   Link to stats page 
   Anything else you want to show? 

- Decide if you want to prevent the extension from running on longer than x amount (because it will be very slow)
	- This way you can support small reddit tables but not have to do it on the full league when stats are being showed anyways
